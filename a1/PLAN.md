# PLAN.md Module 1, Activity 1 - Hello, Class!
In future activities, the `PLAN.md` document is where you will do your pre-coding thinking and planning. For this activity, you will only fill in the *Reflection* section.

## Reflection
It has been several years since I have used VS code. I think the last revision I used was 2016 or 2018. It is an entirely different program at this point. Re-learning it will take some time. I also had a difficult time with Git. While I know what it is and what it is for, I never learned how to use it. I am still not entirely sure I will submit this assignment correctly. While I have dabbled in several languages (C++, MySQL, Visual Basic, Python, HTML/CSS) it has been several years since I have touched any of them. I am looking forward to scraping the rust off, and relearning the basics. Learning Git might also prove useful.  


# PLAN.md Module 1, Activity 2 - Modern Art
This plan is partially filled out as an example.

## What are the tasks?
(This is what you need to do.  This will mostly be taken from the "Requirements" section of the activity description.)
1. Design an ASCII art masterpiece
2. Create a class to print the design to the console

## How can those tasks be broken into smaller steps?
(In this section take each task identified above and break it into individual steps. This can include descriptions, pseudo-code, code snippets, etc. It should include a detailed plan to meet each required element of the activity.)
Task 1: Draw your ASCII art masterpiece below.  What do you *want* to print to the console?







Task 2: What command(s) will create each required line of text?

    (actually write each command here)

## Testing Plan
(In this section you will describe how you will know if your tasks have been done correctly.)
Task 1 - task 1 is not a programming task, so the testing is really just looking at the design and seeing if it is what you want to create.

Task 2 - Add the code to the program one line at a time and test to see what is printed to the console after each step. Do not proceed to the next step until the current line is printed correctly.

## Requirements Check
(In this section, look back to the requirements section of the activity description in README.md and check to see if you met each given requirement.)

- Did you call your class `ModernArt.java`? (Remember capitalization matters!)
- Did you use at least one `println()` statement?
- Did you use at least one `print()` statement?
- Did you use at least one instance of string concatenation?
- Did you use at least one variable?
- Did you use at least one constant?

## Reflection
(Write your reflection here! Look at README.md for the requirements for the reflection.)
